def lift()
  currentfloor = 0 - This keeps a live version of the floor
  movement = 0 - this is to make is exsit to set it as something

  #until -to repeat intil a certain condition is met

 until movement == "stop" do
    print "Please enter the number of floors you would like to move (can also be negative) "
    movement = gets.chomp
    if movement != "stop"
      movement = movement.to_i

#ruby store things as strings so the conversion to the number is necessary due to stop, but to add to the current floor.
      currentfloor = currentfloor + movement
